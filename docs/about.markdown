I am [John Handley](), an economist currently working at Ofcom. I created this website to be a portfolio of my personal projects. I often post about these projects more informally/as I am working on them on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jwhandley17) and publish the code onto my [Github](https://github.com/jwhandley). My academic background is in both economics and political science, and my projects tend to revolve around these topics.
